# Minesweeper
## What is Minesweeper?
The rule of the game is simple, the number on a block shows the number of mines adjacent to it and you have to flag all the mines.
Some terms:
- Flag: Put a flag in a zone when you have confirmed that there is a mine.
- Question Mark: Put a question mark when you suspect that there is a mine. But it is useless.
